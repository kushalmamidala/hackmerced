        This code utilizes a decision tree regressor to predict crop yield based on various features such as area, item, year, average rainfall, pesticides used, and average temperature. It preprocesses the data by one-hot encoding categorical variables and scales the features using StandardScaler. The trained model is evaluated using mean squared error and R^2 score, and then used to make predictions for a given set of input values, returning the predicted yield as output. Crop yield production is crucial for ensuring food security and sustaining the global population. Adequate crop yields not only meet the nutritional needs of people but also support livelihoods and economic growth, particularly in agricultural-dependent regions. Moreover, maximizing crop yields helps to mitigate the risk of food shortages and price volatility, contributing to overall stability in food markets. Additionally, efficient crop production plays a vital role in environmental conservation by minimizing the need for expanding agricultural land into natural habitats and reducing pressure on water resources. Ultimately, prioritizing crop yield production is essential for fostering resilience in the face of challenges such as climate change, population growth, and fluctuating market demands.</h3>
