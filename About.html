          <h3>Our Inspiration</h3>
          <p>The inspiration is to provide farmers with precise yield forecasts so they can make educated decisions and support global food production and sustainability initiatives. We do this by using machine learning to analyze historical crop yield data along with climatic conditions, pesticide usage, and geographic regions. </p>

          <h3>What Does Our Code Do?</h3>
          <p>The provided code conducts regression analysis on agricultural data to predict crop yields using a Decision Tree Regressor model. It begins by loading the dataset and preprocessing it, including one-hot encoding categorical variables and splitting the data into training and testing sets. The features are then scaled, and a Decision Tree Regressor model is trained on the scaled training data. After making predictions on the test set, the model's performance is evaluated using mean squared error and R-squared score metrics. Additionally, the code performs cross-validation to assess the model's generalization performance. Finally, it visualizes the actual versus predicted crop yields and provides functionality to predict crop yields based on user inputs using the trained model. </p>
